                        <p><strong>CHASE, SHOOTOUT, SUSPECTS ARRESTED</strong> An armed robbery occurred at a residence in Hurlyvale, Edenvale. Alerts were quickly distributed on emergency whatsapp groups. Our Special Operations Unit was patrolling in Croydon when they received the alert and immediately headed towards Hurlyvale. Special Operations Commander, Joconiah, noticed a blue Hyundai i20 skip a red robot and proceed into oncoming traffic. Joconiah did a u-turn and the chase was on. The vehicle headed towards Illiondale when a passenger pulled out a firearm and fired shots at him. He returned fire hitting the vehicle's right rear tyre, slowing the suspects down to a halt. Four suspects then exited the vehicle and fled into a residence in Macnab St. Mamba Reaction Officers, EMPD, SAPS, a SAPS Chopper and the K9 unit responded and the chase ensued in full force while the suspects jumped from house to house. All 4 suspects were found and arrested. Thank you to Joconiah "Sniffer Dog" and his special operations team for their dedication and commitment and for once again, putting away criminals!</p>
